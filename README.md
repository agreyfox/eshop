# Dms
[![Current Release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/Dms-cms/Dms.svg)](https://github.com/Dms-cms/Dms/releases/latest)

> Watch the [**video introduction**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_1ncPoLgrg)

Dms is a powerful and efficient open-source HTTP server framework and CMS. It 
provides automatic, free, and secure HTTP/2 over TLS (certificates obtained via 
[Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org)), a useful CMS and scaffolding to 
generate content editors, and a fast HTTP API on which to build modern applications.

Dms is released under the BSD-3-Clause license (see LICENSE).

## Why?
With the rise in popularity of web/mobile apps connected to JSON HTTP APIs, better 
tools to support the development of content servers and management systems are necessary. 
Dms fills the void where you want to reach for Wordpress to get a great CMS, or Rails for
rapid development, but need a fast JSON response in a high-concurrency environment. 

**Because you want to turn this:**  
```bash
$ Dms gen content song title:"string" artist:"string" rating:"int" opinion:"string":richtext spotify_url:"string"
```

**Into this:**

**What's inside**  
- Automatic & Free SSL/TLS<sup id="a1">[1](#f1)</sup>

## Documentation
For more detailed documentation, check out the [docs](https://docs.Dms-cms.org)

## Installation

```
$ go get -u github.com/Dms-cms/Dms/...
```

## Requirements
Go 1.8+

Since HTTP/2 Server Push is used, Go 1.8+ is required. However, it is not 
required of clients connecting to a Dms server to make HTTP/2 requests. 

## Usage

```bash
$ Dms command [flags] <params>
```

## Commands

### new

Creates a project directory of the name supplied as a parameter immediately
following the 'new' option in the $GOPATH/src directory. Note: 'new' depends on 
the program 'git' and possibly a network connection. If there is no local 
repository to clone from at the local machine's $GOPATH, 'new' will attempt to 
clone the 'github.com/Dms-cms/Dms' package from over the network.

Example:
```bash
$ Dms new github.com/nilslice/proj
> New Dms project created at $GOPATH/src/github.com/nilslice/proj
```

Errors will be reported, but successful commands return nothing.

---

### generate, gen, g

Generate boilerplate code for various Dms components, such as `content`.

Example:
```bash
            generator      struct fields and built-in types...
             |              |
             v              v    
$ Dms gen content review title:"string" body:"string":richtext rating:"int"
                     ^                                   ^
                     |                                   |
                    struct type                         (optional) input view specifier
```

The command above will generate the file `content/review.go` with boilerplate
methods, as well as struct definition, and corresponding field tags like:

```go
type Review struct {
	Title  string   `json:"title"`
	Body   string   `json:"body"`
	Rating int      `json:"rating"`
}
```

The generate command will intelligently parse more sophisticated field names
such as 'field_name' and convert it to 'FieldName' and vice versa, only where 
appropriate as per common Go idioms. Errors will be reported, but successful 
generate commands return nothing.

**Input View Specifiers** _(optional)_

The CLI can optionally parse a third parameter on the fields provided to generate 
the type of HTML view an editor field is presented within. If no third parameter
is added, a plain text HTML input will be generated. In the example above, the 
argument shown as `body:string:richtext` would show the Richtext input instead
of a plain text HTML input (as shown in the screenshot). The following input
view specifiers are implemented:

| CLI parameter | Generates |
|---------------|-----------| 
| checkbox | `editor.Checkbox()` |
| custom | generates a pre-styled empty div to fill with HTML |
| file | `editor.File()` |
| hidden | `editor.Input()` + uses type=hidden |
| input, text | `editor.Input()` |
| richtext | `editor.Richtext()` |
| select | `editor.Select()` |
| textarea | `editor.Textarea()` |
| tags | `editor.Tags()` |

---

### build

From within your Dms project directory, running build will copy and move 
the necessary files from your workspace into the vendored directory, and 
will build/compile the project to then be run. 

Optional flags:
- `--gocmd` sets the binary used when executing `go build` within `Dms` build step

Example:
```bash
$ Dms build
(or)
$ Dms build --gocmd=go1.8rc1 # useful for testing
```

Errors will be reported, but successful build commands return nothing.

---

### run

Starts the HTTP server for the JSON API, Admin System, or both.
The segments, separated by a comma, describe which services to start, either 
'admin' (Admin System / CMS backend) or 'api' (JSON API), and, optionally, 
if the server should utilize TLS encryption - served over HTTPS, which is
automatically managed using Let's Encrypt (https://letsencrypt.org) 

Optional flags:
- `--port` sets the port on which the server listens for HTTP requests [defaults to 8080]
- `--https-port` sets the port on which the server listens for HTTPS requests [defaults to 443]
- `--https` enables auto HTTPS management via Let's Encrypt (port is always 443)
- `--dev-https` generates self-signed SSL certificates for development-only (port is 10443)

Example: 
```bash
$ Dms run
(or)
$ Dms run --port=8080 --https admin,api
(or) 
$ Dms run admin
(or)
$ Dms run --port=8888 api
(or)
$ Dms run --dev-https
```
Defaults to `$ Dms run --port=8080 admin,api` (running Admin & API on port 8080, without TLS)

*Note:* 
Admin and API cannot run on separate processes unless you use a copy of the
database, since the first process to open it receives a lock. If you intend
to run the Admin and API on separate processes, you must call them with the
'Dms' command independently.

---

### upgrade

Will backup your own custom project code (like content, add-ons, uploads, etc) so
we can safely re-clone Dms from the latest version you have or from the network 
if necessary. Before running `$ Dms upgrade`, you should update the `Dms`
package by running `$ go get -u github.com/Dms-cms/Dms/...` 

Example:
```bash
$ Dms upgrade
```

---

### add, a

Downloads an add-on to GOPATH/src and copies it to the Dms project's ./addons directory.
Must be called from within a Dms project directory.

Example:
```bash
$ Dms add github.com/bosssauce/fbscheduler
```

Errors will be reported, but successful add commands return nothing.

---

### version, v

Prints the version of Dms your project is using. Must be called from within a 
Dms project directory. By passing the `--cli` flag, the `version` command will 
print the version of the Dms CLI you have installed.

Example:
```bash
$ Dms version
> Dms v0.8.2
(or)
$ Dms version --cli
> Dms v0.9.2
```

---

## Contributing

1. Checkout branch Dms-dev
2. Make code changes
3. Test changes to Dms-dev branch
    - make a commit to Dms-dev
    - to manually test, you will need to use a new copy (Dms new path/to/code), but pass the --dev flag so that Dms generates a new copy from the Dms-dev branch, not master by default (i.e. `$Dms new --dev /path/to/code`)
    - build and run with $ Dms build and $ Dms run
4. To add back to master: 
    - first push to origin Dms-dev
    - create a pull request 
    - will then be merged into master

_A typical contribution workflow might look like:_
```bash
# clone the repository and checkout Dms-dev
$ git clone https://github.com/Dms-cms/Dms path/to/local/Dms # (or your fork)
$ git checkout Dms-dev

# install Dms with go get or from your own local path
$ go get github.com/Dms-cms/Dms/...
# or
$ cd /path/to/local/Dms 
$ go install ./...

# edit files, add features, etc
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m 'edited files, added features, etc'

# now you need to test the feature.. make a new Dms project, but pass --dev flag
$ Dms new --dev /path/to/new/project # will create $GOPATH/src/path/to/new/project

# build & run Dms from the new project directory
$ cd /path/to/new/project
$ Dms build && Dms run

# push to your origin:Dms-dev branch and create a PR at Dms-cms/Dms
$ git push origin Dms-dev
# ... go to https://github.com/Dms-cms/Dms and create a PR
```

**Note:** if you intend to work on your own fork and contribute from it, you will
need to also pass `--fork=path/to/your/fork` (using OS-standard filepath structure),
where `path/to/your/fork` _must_ be within `$GOPATH/src`, and you are working from a branch
called `Dms-dev`. 

For example: 
```bash
# ($GOPATH/src is implied in the fork path, do not add it yourself)
$ Dms new --dev --fork=github.com/nilslice/Dms /path/to/new/project
```
